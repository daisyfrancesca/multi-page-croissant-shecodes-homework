    <h1>🥐 Croissants 🥐</h1>
    Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.
    Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant
    was
    developed in the early 20th century. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but
    unbaked
    dough made them into a fast food that can be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
    Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants
    sold
    in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
